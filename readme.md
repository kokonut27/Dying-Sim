# Dying Sim. 
###### A simulator based on dying unlimitedly.

## Intro
#### Ever wanted to die a lot, be reborn, and die again? This is the perfect game for you (no joke), this does exactly those things above that i wrote. Amazing, right? You can also view this on github, right [here](https://github.com/JBYT27/Dying-Sim). Moving on now...

## About
#### The intro has pretty much described everything, but this is a dying game. You can die as much and live and die as much again. Crazy, isn't it. That's it though. Oh, and I forgot to mention, this is kinda like a clicker game, except instead of clicking, you enter the corresponding number.

## Feedback
#### I'm pretty sure this has no bugs, but if there are, pls comment them and also give feedback on the game. Thanks!

## Code
#### The code is based on a `while` statement, so it keeps looping, that is, until you live. But yeah. It has colors, clearing the console, etc.

## Closing
#### I hope you guys enjoy this. It's been pretty fun making this, both the comments and the code. Bye! I hope you like it as well! :D
